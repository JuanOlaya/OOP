# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Processing

The following exercises have been used in the subjects Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Computer Graphics in the program Digital Media Engineering in the university School of Arts and Letters in Bogot√° since 2016.2 to 2018.1. taught by Juan Olaya. This subject ... was scripting tool ... used [Processing](https://processing.org/)
